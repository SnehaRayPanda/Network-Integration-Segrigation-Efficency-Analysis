# Network-Integration-Segrigation-Efficency-Analysis
To analyse brain network integration-segrigation, smal-worldness and efficency fgor fMRI, EEG data


The code compute absolute and normalized graph theory measures, which includes Brain Network Integration, Segregation, Small worldness, global and local efficiency, degree plath length, modularity, comunity index etc... The program uses BCT functions, so to run this program you should have BCT toolbox in your MATLAB path BCT toolbox can be download from here: https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/
